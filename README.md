# MinArena
Personal project of a twitch MOBA

It is more like an experimental thing, but I am opening the code of the game if anyone gets interested.

This is a simple game designed over the client x server model.

Some characteristics are:
 - C++ Source code
 - SDL as graphic library to the client application
 - UDP transport protocol

There are many many many enhancements to be done, as it is a graduation project. So there are many things to be done.

Thanks for reading this, tough!
